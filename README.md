# Scout
A search space expander for small problems

## Usage
Scout is meant for usage with the `dot` graph visualizer, which can be obtained as part of the GraphViz project.
On mac, `brew install graphviz` will install it.

Once you have `dot`, type `python Scout.py | dot -Tpng > out.png` to render the graph to `out.png`.
